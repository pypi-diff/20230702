-        
-        **sterm** is a minimal serial terminal that focus on being easy to use and not sucking. - This client simply works.
-        It has inline input and supports Unicode (utf-8).
-        Each character typed gets directly send to the connected device without buffering.
-        It writes whatever it receives to *stdout* so that also Unicode and ANSI escape sequences work as expected.
-        
-        ### Core Use-Cases
-        
-        *Ideal for debugging:*<br/>
-        With the ``--binary`` option, the received data will be output byte wise as hexadecimal numbers.
-        
-        *Ideal for a remote Linux shell:*<br/>
-        With the ``--noecho`` option, each character typed gets directly send to the connected device without buffering and echoing.
-        This makes the Linux console usage seamlessly like using telnet or ssh.
-        
-        ### Core Features
-        
-        - Inline input
-        - No line buffering
-        - Unicode support

-        
-        ## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
-        
-        There are two ways to install _sterm_.
-        Directly using `pip` or from the cloned repository.
-        
-        ### Installation using pip
-        
-        ```bash
-        pip install sterm
-        ```
-        
-        ### Installation from Repository
-        
-        ```bash
-        # Download
-        git clone https://github.com/rstemmer/sterm.git
-        cd sterm
-        
-        # Dependencies
-        pip install pyserial
-        
-        # Install Package
-        pip install .
-        
-        ```
-        
-        
-        ## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>
-        
-        *sterm* has three interfaces:
-        
-        1. Configuration files
-        2. The command line interface
-        3. Escape commands
-        
-        ### Configuration via files
-        
-        TODO - Not yet implemented.
-        
-        ### Command Line Arguments
-        
-        ```bash
-        sterm [-h] [--noecho] [--escape character] [--binary] [-b BAUDRATE] [-f FORMAT] [-w logfile] DEVICE
-        ```
-        
-        When a command line argument is contradictory to a setting in the configuration files, the command line argument has higher priority.
-        
-          * __-h__: Print help.
-          * __-n__: Enable _noecho_ mode. _Default_ is echoing each entered key to _stdout_.
-          * __--escape__: Define an alternative escape character. _Default_ is escape ("\e").
-          * __--binary__: Print hexadecimal values instead of Unicode characters. (Only applied on output, input will still be UTF-8)
-          * __-b__: Baudrate. _Default:_ 115200 baud.
-          * __-f__: Configuration-triple: xyz with x = bytelength in bits {5,6,7,8}; y = parity {N,E,O}; z = stopbits {1,2}. _Default:_ "8N1" - _8_ data bits, _no_ parity bits and _1_ stop bit.
-          * __-w__: Write received data into a file.
-        
-        _DEVICE_ is the path to the serial terminal.
-        For example _/dev/ttyS0_, _/dev/ttyUSB0_, _/dev/ttyUART0_, _/dev/ttyACM0_, _/dev/pts/42_.
-        
-        For details read the man-page.
-        
-        ### Escape commands
-        
-        The following strings can be entered while _sterm_ is running.
-        Just hit the escape-key and then enter the commands.
-        They get not send to the device.
-        Instead they are interpreted by _sterm_.
-        The preceded escape character can be defined with --escape.
-        Default is the escape key ("\e").
-        
-          * __exit__: quit sterm
-          * __version__: print version
-        
-        ### Examples
-        
-        Send _ping_ to UART0 and exit:
-        ```
-        sterm /dev/ttyUART0
-        ping
-        pong
-        ^[exit
-        ```
-        
-        Send _hello_ to a serial device with 9600 baud, 7 data bits, even parity, and 2 stop bits. Then exit:
-        ```
-        sterm -b 9600 -f 7E2 /dev/ttyS0
-        hello
-        world
-        ^[exit
-        ```
-        
-        Connecting to a Linux device
-        ```
-        sterm --noecho --escape _ /dev/ttyUSB0
-        ~# whoami
-        root
-        ~# _exit
-        ```
-        
-        Communicating with two _sterm_ instances via a pseudo terminal for testing:
-        ![A picture that demonstrates the possibility of receiving ANSI escape sequences and unicode charaters](/stermscreenshot.png?raw=true "Testrun showing some capabilities of sterm")
-        
-        
-        ## ‚õèÔ∏è Building and Testing <a name = "built_using"></a>
-        
-        ### Testing
-        
-        To test _sterm_ from the sources, just call the `test.py` script.
-        It runs the command line interface of _sterm_.
-        
-        You can use `socat` to create a virtual serial connection with two endings, so that you can use two `sterm` processes to communicate with each other:
-        
-        ```bash
-        socat -d -d pty,raw,echo=0 pty,raw,echo=0
-        ```
-        
-        ### Building a new Package
-        
-        To build a new package from the source code, just execute the `pkg-make.sh` script.
-        Make sure to update the version number in the `sterm/cli.py` file.
-        This version number, as well as the README.md file gets read by the setup.py file.
-        
-        ```bash
-        vim sterm/cli.py
-        ./pkg-make.sh
-        ```

+## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
+
+There are two ways to install _sterm_.
+**A:** Directly using `pip` or **B:** from the cloned repository.
+
+### Precondition
+
+_sterm_ requires Python 3 to run.
+Before you start installing _sterm_ make sure you use the correct version.
+Depending on your distribution, the you may need to use `pip3` instead of `pip`.
+You can check your Python version by executing the following commands:
+
+```bash
+python --version
+pip --version
+```
+
+Both should print a version number beginning with 3.
+If not, you need to use `pip3` to explicit use Python 3.
+
+For a user-only installation, call `pip ...` as user.
+For a system-wide installation you need to be root, or call `sudo pip ...`.
+
+### A: Installation using pip
+
+```bash
+pip install sterm
+```
+
+### B: Installation from Repository
+
+```bash
+# Download
+git clone https://github.com/rstemmer/sterm.git
+cd sterm
+
+# Dependencies
+pip install pyserial
+
+# Install Package
+pip install .
+
+```
+
+### Check installation
+
+After installation you can check if _sterm_ is successfully installed using `whereis`.
+```bash

+There should be two files listed.
+ - `sterm` is the executable, the command you run.
+ - `sterm.1` is the manual for `sterm` that can be read by executing `man sterm` on the command line.
+
+On a system-wide installation, _sterm_ is usually installed to /usr/bin.

+
+During the installation process, `pip` should install all dependencies recursively.
+To be sure nothing is missing, you can run `pip check sterm`.
+It prints all missing dependencies or version conflicts.
+You can install missing dependencies via `pip`.
+When version conflicts are listed, you can hope they do not matter or install an explicit version via `pip` as well.
+
+
+## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>
+
+To execute _sterm_ you just have to call the `sterm` command in your shell.
+`sterm` requires one argument, the device you want to access.
+All other arguments listed in the subsection below are optional.
+
+UART-Devices are listed in the /dev directory with the prefix `tty`.
+Most UART-Devices are addressable via /dev/ttyUSBx or /dev/ttyACMx were x is a number depending on the order they got recognized by the Linux kernel.
+
+
+*sterm* has two interfaces:
+
+1. The command line interface
+2. Escape commands
+
+
+### Command Line Arguments
+
+```bash
+sterm [-h] [--noecho] [--escape character] [--binary] [-b BAUDRATE] [-f FORMAT] [-w logfile] DEVICE
+```
+
+When a command line argument is contradictory to a setting in the configuration files, the command line argument has higher priority.
+
+  * __-h__: Print help.
+  * __-n__: Enable _noecho_ mode. _Default_ is echoing each entered key to _stdout_.
+  * __--escape__: Define an alternative escape character. _Default_ is escape ("\e").
+  * __--binary__: Print hexadecimal values instead of Unicode characters. (Only applied on output, input will still be UTF-8)
+  * __-b__: Baudrate. _Default:_ 115200 baud.
+  * __-f__: Configuration-triple: xyz with x = bytelength in bits {5,6,7,8}; y = parity {N,E,O}; z = stopbits {1,2}. _Default:_ "8N1" - _8_ data bits, _no_ parity bits and _1_ stop bit.
+  * __-w__: Write received data into a file.
+
+_DEVICE_ is the path to the serial terminal.
+For example _/dev/ttyS0_, _/dev/ttyUSB0_, _/dev/ttyUART0_, _/dev/ttyACM0_, _/dev/pts/42_.
+
+For details read the man-page.
+
+### Escape commands
+
+The following strings can be entered while _sterm_ is running.
+Just hit the escape-key and then enter the commands.
+They get not send to the device.
+Instead they are interpreted by _sterm_.
+The preceded escape character can be defined with --escape.
+Default is the escape key ("\e").
+
+  * __exit__: quit sterm
+  * __version__: print version
+
+### Examples
+
+Send _ping_ to UART0 and exit:
+```
+sterm /dev/ttyUART0
+ping
+pong
+^[exit
+```
+
+Send _hello_ to a serial device with 9600 baud, 7 data bits, even parity, and 2 stop bits. Then exit:
+```
+sterm -b 9600 -f 7E2 /dev/ttyS0
+hello
+world
+^[exit
+```
+
+Connecting to a Linux device
+```
+sterm --noecho --escape _ /dev/ttyUSB0
+~# whoami
+root
+~# _exit
+```

+
+### Testing
+
+To test _sterm_ from the sources, just call the `test.py` script.
+It runs the command line interface of _sterm_.
+
+You can use `socat` to create a virtual serial connection with two endings, so that you can use two `sterm` processes to communicate with each other:
+
+```bash
+socat -d -d pty,raw,echo=0 pty,raw,echo=0
+```
+
+### Building a new Package
+
+To build a new package from the source code, just execute the `pkg-make.sh` script.
+Make sure to update the version number in the `sterm/cli.py` file.
+This version number, as well as the README.md file gets read by the setup.py file.

 There are two ways to install _sterm_.
-Directly using `pip` or from the cloned repository.
+**A:** Directly using `pip` or **B:** from the cloned repository.
+
+### Precondition
+
+_sterm_ requires Python 3 to run.
+Before you start installing _sterm_ make sure you use the correct version.
+Depending on your distribution, the you may need to use `pip3` instead of `pip`.
+You can check your Python version by executing the following commands:
+
+```bash
+python --version
+pip --version
+```
 
-### Installation using pip
+Both should print a version number beginning with 3.
+If not, you need to use `pip3` to explicit use Python 3.
+
+For a user-only installation, call `pip ...` as user.
+For a system-wide installation you need to be root, or call `sudo pip ...`.
+
+### A: Installation using pip
 
 ```bash
 pip install sterm
 ```
 
-### Installation from Repository
+### B: Installation from Repository
 
 ```bash
 # Download
 git clone https://github.com/rstemmer/sterm.git
 cd sterm
 
 # Dependencies
 pip install pyserial
 
 # Install Package
 pip install .
 
 ```
 
+### Check installation
+
+After installation you can check if _sterm_ is successfully installed using `whereis`.
+```bash
+whereis sterm
+#Outpu: sterm: /usr/bin/sterm /usr/man/man1/sterm.1
+```
+There should be two files listed.
+ - `sterm` is the executable, the command you run.
+ - `sterm.1` is the manual for `sterm` that can be read by executing `man sterm` on the command line.
+
+On a system-wide installation, _sterm_ is usually installed to /usr/bin.
+If you only installed to for a single user, it is usually installed to ~/.local/bin

-        
-        **sterm** is a minimal serial terminal that focus on being easy to use and not sucking. - This client simply works.
-        It has inline input and supports Unicode (utf-8).
-        Each character typed gets directly send to the connected device without buffering.
-        It writes whatever it receives to *stdout* so that also Unicode and ANSI escape sequences work as expected.
-        
-        ### Core Use-Cases
-        
-        *Ideal for debugging:*<br/>
-        With the ``--binary`` option, the received data will be output byte wise as hexadecimal numbers.
-        
-        *Ideal for a remote Linux shell:*<br/>
-        With the ``--noecho`` option, each character typed gets directly send to the connected device without buffering and echoing.
-        This makes the Linux console usage seamlessly like using telnet or ssh.
-        
-        ### Core Features
-        
-        - Inline input
-        - No line buffering
-        - Unicode support
-        - ANSI Escape Sequences supported

-        It runs the command line interface of _sterm_.
-        
-        You can use `socat` to create a virtual serial connection with two endings, so that you can use two `sterm` processes to communicate with each other:

-        
-        To build a new package from the source code, just execute the `pkg-make.sh` script.
-        Make sure to update the version number in the `sterm/cli.py` file.
-        This version number, as well as the README.md file gets read by the setup.py file.

+## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
+
+**sterm** is a minimal serial terminal that focus on being easy to use and not sucking. - This client simply works.
+It has inline input and supports Unicode (utf-8).
+Each character typed gets directly send to the connected device without buffering.
+It writes whatever it receives to *stdout* so that also Unicode and ANSI escape sequences work as expected.
+
+### Core Use-Cases
+
+*Ideal for debugging:*<br/>
+With the ``--binary`` option, the received data will be output byte wise as hexadecimal numbers.
+
+*Ideal for a remote Linux shell:*<br/>
+With the ``--noecho`` option, each character typed gets directly send to the connected device without buffering and echoing.
+This makes the Linux console usage seamlessly like using telnet or ssh.
+
+### Core Features
+
+- Inline input
+- No line buffering
+- Unicode support
+- ANSI Escape Sequences supported
+- No GUI
+
+
+## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
+
+There are two ways to install _sterm_.
+**A:** Directly using `pip` or **B:** from the cloned repository.
+
+### Precondition
+
+_sterm_ requires Python 3 to run.
+Before you start installing _sterm_ make sure you use the correct version.
+Depending on your distribution, the you may need to use `pip3` instead of `pip`.
+You can check your Python version by executing the following commands:
+
+```bash
+python --version
+pip --version
+```
+
+Both should print a version number beginning with 3.
+If not, you need to use `pip3` to explicit use Python 3.
+
+For a user-only installation, call `pip ...` as user.
+For a system-wide installation you need to be root, or call `sudo pip ...`.
+
+### A: Installation using pip
+
+```bash
+pip install sterm
+```
+
+### B: Installation from Repository
+
+```bash
+# Download
+git clone https://github.com/rstemmer/sterm.git
+cd sterm
+
+# Dependencies
+pip install pyserial
+
+# Install Package
+pip install .
+
+```
+
+### Check installation
+
+After installation you can check if _sterm_ is successfully installed using `whereis`.
+```bash
+whereis sterm
+#Outpu: sterm: /usr/bin/sterm /usr/man/man1/sterm.1
+```
+There should be two files listed.
+ - `sterm` is the executable, the command you run.
+ - `sterm.1` is the manual for `sterm` that can be read by executing `man sterm` on the command line.
+
+On a system-wide installation, _sterm_ is usually installed to /usr/bin.
+If you only installed to for a single user, it is usually installed to ~/.local/bin
+
+During the installation process, `pip` should install all dependencies recursively.
+To be sure nothing is missing, you can run `pip check sterm`.
+It prints all missing dependencies or version conflicts.
+You can install missing dependencies via `pip`.
+When version conflicts are listed, you can hope they do not matter or install an explicit version via `pip` as well.
+
+
+## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>
+
+To execute _sterm_ you just have to call the `sterm` command in your shell.
+`sterm` requires one argument, the device you want to access.
+All other arguments listed in the subsection below are optional.
+
+UART-Devices are listed in the /dev directory with the prefix `tty`.
+Most UART-Devices are addressable via /dev/ttyUSBx or /dev/ttyACMx were x is a number depending on the order they got recognized by the Linux kernel.
+
+
+*sterm* has two interfaces:
+
+1. The command line interface
+2. Escape commands
+
+
+### Command Line Arguments
+
+```bash
+sterm [-h] [--noecho] [--escape character] [--binary] [-b BAUDRATE] [-f FORMAT] [-w logfile] DEVICE
+```
+
+When a command line argument is contradictory to a setting in the configuration files, the command line argument has higher priority.
+
+  * __-h__: Print help.
+  * __-n__: Enable _noecho_ mode. _Default_ is echoing each entered key to _stdout_.
+  * __--escape__: Define an alternative escape character. _Default_ is escape ("\e").
+  * __--binary__: Print hexadecimal values instead of Unicode characters. (Only applied on output, input will still be UTF-8)
+  * __-b__: Baudrate. _Default:_ 115200 baud.
+  * __-f__: Configuration-triple: xyz with x = bytelength in bits {5,6,7,8}; y = parity {N,E,O}; z = stopbits {1,2}. _Default:_ "8N1" - _8_ data bits, _no_ parity bits and _1_ stop bit.
+  * __-w__: Write received data into a file.
+
+_DEVICE_ is the path to the serial terminal.
+For example _/dev/ttyS0_, _/dev/ttyUSB0_, _/dev/ttyUART0_, _/dev/ttyACM0_, _/dev/pts/42_.
+
+For details read the man-page.
+
+### Escape commands
+
+The following strings can be entered while _sterm_ is running.
+Just hit the escape-key and then enter the commands.
+They get not send to the device.
+Instead they are interpreted by _sterm_.
+The preceded escape character can be defined with --escape.
+Default is the escape key ("\e").
+
+  * __exit__: quit sterm
+  * __version__: print version
+
+### Examples
+
+Send _ping_ to UART0 and exit:
+```
+sterm /dev/ttyUART0
+ping
+pong
+^[exit
+```
+
+Send _hello_ to a serial device with 9600 baud, 7 data bits, even parity, and 2 stop bits. Then exit:
+```
+sterm -b 9600 -f 7E2 /dev/ttyS0
+hello
+world
+^[exit
+```
+
+Connecting to a Linux device
+```
+sterm --noecho --escape _ /dev/ttyUSB0
+~# whoami
+root
+~# _exit
+```

+
+
+## ‚õèÔ∏è Building and Testing <a name = "built_using"></a>
+
+### Testing
+
+To test _sterm_ from the sources, just call the `test.py` script.
+It runs the command line interface of _sterm_.
+
+You can use `socat` to create a virtual serial connection with two endings, so that you can use two `sterm` processes to communicate with each other:
+
+```bash
+socat -d -d pty,raw,echo=0 pty,raw,echo=0
+```
+
+### Building a new Package
+
+To build a new package from the source code, just execute the `pkg-make.sh` script.
+Make sure to update the version number in the `sterm/cli.py` file.
+This version number, as well as the README.md file gets read by the setup.py file.
+
+```bash
+vim sterm/cli.py
+./pkg-make.sh
+```
