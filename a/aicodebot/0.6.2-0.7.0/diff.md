 # AI Code Bot ü§ñ
 
 ## Your AI-powered coding companion
 
 AICodeBot is a coding assistant designed to make your coding life easier. With capabilities to perform code reviews, manage dependencies, and even suggest improvements, think of it as your AI version of a pair programmer - a team member that accelerates the pace of development and helps you write better code.
 
-There are lot of ways to use AICodeBot that we have planned. To start, it's a [command-line tool](https://pypi.org/project/aicodebot/) that you can use to generate commit messages, debug code, and review code. In the future, we plan to integrate it with GitHub Actions, Slack, and other tools to make it even more useful.
+We've planned to build out multiple different interfaces for interacting with AICodeBot. To start, it's a [command-line tool](https://pypi.org/project/aicodebot/) that you can use to generate commit messages, debug code, and review code. In the future, we plan to integrate it with GitHub Actions, Slack, and other tools to make it even more useful.

+‚ö†Ô∏è AICodeBot currently uses OpenAI's ChatGPT large language models, which can hallucinate and be confidently wrong. Sometimes it does dumb things, which is why we have you confirm before it does anything permanent. Much like Tesla's Full Self Driving, you have to keep your hands on the wheel.
 
 We're using AICodeBot to build AICodeBot, and it's getting better all the time.Ô∏è We're looking for contributors to help us build it out. See [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/novara-ai/AICodeBot/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more.
 
 ### What it's not
 
 `aicodebot` is a tool for developers, not a replacement for them. It's not going to replace your job, but it will make your job easier and more fun. It's not going to take over the world, but it will help us build a better one. See the *Alignment* section below for more.
 
 It's also not a "build a site for me in 5 minutes" tool that takes a well constructed prompt and builds a scaffold for you. There are [other tools](https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer) for that, Instead, AICodeBot is built to work with existing code bases and help you improve them at the git-commit level. It's designed to multiply the effectiveness of capable engineers.
 
-## Current features - how you can use it
+## Current features - how you can use it today
 
 ### AI-Assisted Git Commit
 
-`aicodebot commit` will run pre-commit for you to check syntax, and then generate a commit message for you based on the changes you've made. In about as much effort as typing "fix bug" for the commit message, you will get a high quality commit message that describes the change. It will also commit the changes for you once everything checks out.

 ### AI-Assisted Code Review
 
-`aicodebot review` will run a code review on your code and suggest improvements. By default it will look at [un]staged changes, and you can also supply a specific commit hash to review. It's goal is to suggest how to make the code better, and we've found that it often teaches us new things about our code. It's not perfect, but it's a great way to get a second set of robot eyes on your code.

It's not perfect, but it's a great way to get a second set of robot eyes on your code.
 
 ### AI-Assisted Debugging
 
-`aicodebot debug $command` will run the command and capture the log message. It will pass the error message, stack trace, comand output, etc. to the AI and respond with some suggestions on how to fix it. It saves a trip to stackoverflow in a separate window, allowing you to stay in terminal with all the context.

-### AI-Assisted Code Creation (Work in Progress)
-
-The aicodebot code feature is an AI-powered tool that automates coding tasks. It understands your task, formulates a plan, learns necessary information, and generates code that fits your codebase style. It also reviews its own work, modifies the local code, and creates unit tests. This feature is designed to streamline your coding process and boost productivity. In the future, we plan to enhance its performance through a continuous learning system based on user feedback and interaction outcomes.

 ### Open AI key setup
 
 The first time you run it, you'll be prompted to enter your OpenAI API Key, which is required, as we use OpenAI's large language models for the AI. You can get one for free by visiting your [API key settings page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys").
 
-#### GPT-3.5 vs GPT-4
+#### Which Language Model? GPT-3.5 vs GPT-4
 
 When using AICodeBot, you have the option to use either GPT-3.5 or GPT-4. While GPT-4 can often provide more accurate and detailed responses, GPT-3.5 is faster and might be sufficient for simpler tasks. We highly recommend GPT-4.
 
 Not all OpenAI accounts have GPT-4 API access enabled. By default, AICodeBot will use GPT-4 if your OpenAI account supports it, we will check the first time you run it. Tip: If your OpenAI API does not support GPT-4, you can ask to be added to the waitlist [here](https://openai.com/waitlist/gpt-4-api)
 
+Note: We'll be adding more options for AI models in the future, including those that can be run locally, such as [GPT4all](https://gpt4all.io/) and HuggingFace's [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/).

 ## Roadmap of Upcoming Features
 
 ### Code Workflow Improvements
 
 * [X] **Assisted Git Commit**: Automatically generate a commit message based on the changes you've made
 * [X] **Assisted Debugging**: Run a command with aicodebot and it captures the log message and tries to figure out what's going on from the error message.  Eventually, it could also suggest fixes for the error and make the changes for you. Try it out with `aicodebot debug $command`
 * [X] **Code Review**: Provides feedback on potential issues in code,  and suggests improvements to make it better.

With capabilities to perform code reviews, manage dependencies, and even suggest improvements, think of it as your AI version of a pair programmer - a team member that accelerates the pace of development and helps you write better code.
 
-There are lot of ways to use AICodeBot that we have planned. To start, it's a [command-line tool](https://pypi.org/project/aicodebot/) that you can use to generate commit messages, debug code, and review code. In the future, we plan to integrate it with GitHub Actions, Slack, and other tools to make it even more useful.

Sometimes it does dumb things, which is why we have you confirm before it does anything permanent. Much like Tesla's Full Self Driving, you have to keep your hands on the wheel.
 
 We're using AICodeBot to build AICodeBot, and it's getting better all the time.Ô∏è We're looking for contributors to help us build it out. See [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/novara-ai/AICodeBot/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more.
 
 ### What it's not
 
 `aicodebot` is a tool for developers, not a replacement for them. It's not going to replace your job, but it will make your job easier and more fun. It's not going to take over the world, but it will help us build a better one. See the *Alignment* section below for more.
 
 It's also not a "build a site for me in 5 minutes" tool that takes a well constructed prompt and builds a scaffold for you. There are [other tools](https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer) for that, Instead, AICodeBot is built to work with existing code bases and help you improve them at the git-commit level. It's designed to multiply the effectiveness of capable engineers.

 ### AI-Assisted Git Commit
 
-`aicodebot commit` will run pre-commit for you to check syntax, and then generate a commit message for you based on the changes you've made. In about as much effort as typing "fix bug" for the commit message, you will get a high quality commit message that describes the change. It will also commit the changes for you once everything checks out.

 ### AI-Assisted Code Review
 
-`aicodebot review` will run a code review on your code and suggest improvements. By default it will look at [un]staged changes, and you can also supply a specific commit hash to review. It's goal is to suggest how to make the code better, and we've found that it often teaches us new things about our code. It's not perfect, but it's a great way to get a second set of robot eyes on your code.

It's not perfect, but it's a great way to get a second set of robot eyes on your code.
 
 ### AI-Assisted Debugging
 
-`aicodebot debug $command` will run the command and capture the log message. It will pass the error message, stack trace, comand output, etc. to the AI and respond with some suggestions on how to fix it. It saves a trip to stackoverflow in a separate window, allowing you to stay in terminal with all the context.

-### AI-Assisted Code Creation (Work in Progress)
-
-The aicodebot code feature is an AI-powered tool that automates coding tasks. It understands your task, formulates a plan, learns necessary information, and generates code that fits your codebase style. It also reviews its own work, modifies the local code, and creates unit tests. This feature is designed to streamline your coding process and boost productivity. In the future, we plan to enhance its performance through a continuous learning system based on user feedback and interaction outcomes.

 ### Open AI key setup
 
 The first time you run it, you'll be prompted to enter your OpenAI API Key, which is required, as we use OpenAI's large language models for the AI. You can get one for free by visiting your [API key settings page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys").

+#### Which Language Model? GPT-3.5 vs GPT-4
 
 When using AICodeBot, you have the option to use either GPT-3.5 or GPT-4. While GPT-4 can often provide more accurate and detailed responses, GPT-3.5 is faster and might be sufficient for simpler tasks. We highly recommend GPT-4.
 
 Not all OpenAI accounts have GPT-4 API access enabled. By default, AICodeBot will use GPT-4 if your OpenAI account supports it, we will check the first time you run it. Tip: If your OpenAI API does not support GPT-4, you can ask to be added to the waitlist [here](https://openai.com/waitlist/gpt-4-api)
